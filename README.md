# ReclaimPrivacy is no longer being maintained.

It appears the time has come to shut down this project. We had a good run,
and in the end we were able to play a part in raising awareness around privacy,
and hopefully influence some of the privacy improvements that Facebook did
eventually implement.

If you still have old bookmarks pointing to ReclaimPrivacy.org or the privacy
scanner bookmarklet, I recommend removing those bookmarks from your browser.

Even though this was a small after-hours project for me, I am thankful to
everyone who was a part of this a few years back. Please continue to keep safe
on the web, and keep track of your privacy.
