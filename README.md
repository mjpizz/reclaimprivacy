# Important: Please remove all bookmarks pointing to ReclaimPrivacy.org

**ReclaimPrivacy.org and ReclaimPrivacy.com have expired and been re-purchased
by another organization.** I recommend removing the ReclaimPrivacy bookmarklet
from your bookmarks. Do not use it, since it is not controlled by us anymore.

With that, it appears the time has come to shut down Reclaim Privacy on Facebook
and Twitter as well. We had a good run, and in the end we were able to play a
part in raising awareness around privacy, and hopefully influence some of the
privacy improvements that Facebook did eventually implement.

**For the curious:** This domain expiration was an error on my part. The
expiration notice got lost in an email filter, and I did not renew the domains
in time. I am very sorry about this, and hope you all can forgive my oversight.
Even though this was a small after-hours project for me, I still feel
responsible to you all. Please continue to keep safe on the web, and keep track
of your privacy. And thank you everyone for being a part of this!
