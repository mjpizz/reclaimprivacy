          It appears the time has come to shut down this project. We had a good run,
          and in the end we were able to play a part in raising awareness around privacy,
          and hopefully influence some of the privacy improvements that Facebook did
          eventually implement.

          If you still have old bookmarks pointing to ReclaimPrivacy.org or the privacy
          scanner bookmarklet, I recommend removing those bookmarks from your browser.

          Even though this was a small after-hours project for me, <strong>I am thankful to
          everyone who was a part of this back in 2010</strong>. Please continue to keep safe
          on the web, and keep track of your privacy.
